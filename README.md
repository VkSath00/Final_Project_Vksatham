# Fatal Officer Related Shootings in the United States
<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>Since January 1st of 2015, United States Law Enforcement have shot and killed 6800 people. In the recent events of police shootings affecting individuals unarmed or with a non-lethal weapon, I set out a goal for this project to distinguish the location of every incidence of shooting and display the weapon that was utilized by the suspect. Weapons are displayed for each case, and will distinguish whether the suspect was armed or unarmed. Many shootings that occur are in the event of a non lethal weapon being present like pepper spray or a toy gun, which continues to be a problem in the United States when considering the general "shoot first ask questions later" motto by law enforcement. This tensile situation regarding excessive force by police officers has been a hot political issue for some time now which is why I chose to research and display my findings on this map. When observing an incidence of a shooting, click on the highlighted dot and a popup window will indicate the armed status of the suspect in question of that shooting.</p>

<h1> Goals </h1> 
The goal of my project is to display the excessive force taken by police officers and isolate the instances where the shootings may have not been justified. I would like for the incidences of shootings to be recorded and displayed as a collective so that it would be visualizable. I also wanted it to be possible to see what kinds of weapons were most commonly used by suspects in these officer related shootings and identify trends in cities of various population sizes and densities. I also wanted for it to be visual in which ethnicity was most affected by police shootings in the United States as a collective.
