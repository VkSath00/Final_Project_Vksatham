# Fatal Officer Related Shootings in the United States
<h1>Project Description</h1>
<p>Since January 1st of 2015, United States Law Enforcement have shot and killed 6800 people. In the recent events of police shootings affecting individuals unarmed or with a non-lethal weapon, my goal for this project is to distinguish the location of every incidence of shooting and display the weapon that was utilized by the suspect. Weapons are displayed for each case, and will distinguish whether the suspect was armed or unarmed. The tensile situation regarding excessive force by police officers has been a political issue for some time now which is why I chose to research and display my findings on this map.</p>

<h1> Goals </h1> 
The goal of my project is to display the excessive force taken by police officers and isolate the instances where the shootings may have not been justified. I would like for the incidences of shootings to be recorded and displayed as a collective so that it would be visualizable. I also wanted it to be possible to see what kinds of weapons were most commonly used by suspects in these officer related shootings and identify trends in cities of various population sizes and densities. I also wanted for it to be visual in which ethnicity was most affected by police shootings in the United States as a collective.
